MALWARE DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
----------------------------------------
What is malware?
Malware is a software executable file that is designed to damage or to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.


Impact :
*Gain access to sensitive information
*Slows down computer performance
*DDos attacks and money spent for prevention of DDos
*Restrict access to user files

Solution
Machine Learning techniques to detect malware file
Analyzing Protable Executale (PE) file headers to classify  a file as malware
Random Forest classification algorithm can be used to classify the malware file using information from PE headers.
